Blood Sugar Visualization Graph: Features Overview
Main Features
Dual-Line Display: Shows actual readings (solid purple line) and estimated values (dashed purple line)
Smart Connectivity: Connects actual readings only when they're within 20 minutes of each other (adjustable)
Target-Based Estimation: Estimated line gradually returns to target glucose after readings
Reference Lines: Clearly displays target glucose, high, and low thresholds with horizontal reference lines
Current Time Indicator: Red vertical line shows the current time position on the graph
Color Coding
Purple Dots/Line: Actual blood glucose readings
Dashed Purple Line: Estimated blood glucose pattern
Green Range: Normal blood glucose zone (within target range)
Orange Line: High threshold (30% above target)
Red Line: Low threshold (30% below target)
Key Controls
Date Range: Select custom date range or use quick preset buttons (Last 24h, Last Week, Last Month)
Connect Readings: Control maximum time gap (in minutes) to connect actual readings
Return to Target: Adjust how quickly estimated values return to target glucose level
Fill Options: Choose to fill from range start and extend to graph end
View Toggle: Switch between chart and table views for detailed data analysis
Realistic Estimation
All estimated values return to target glucose after a period of time (no prolonged elevation)
No artificial rising patterns without meal or activity data
Smooth transitions between actual readings and estimated values
Estimation fills gaps at beginning of time range, between readings, and to current time/graph end
Interaction Features
Hover Tooltips: Display detailed info about any point (reading time, glucose value, status)
Legend: Clear explanation of all visual elements and settings
Target Info: Shows patient's target glucose and current settings at top of chart
This visualization provides a physiologically accurate representation of blood glucose
